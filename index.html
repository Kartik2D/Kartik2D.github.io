      <h1>What happens when you cross kinaesthetics with interaction design?</h1>
      
      <div class="text-container">
      Kinaesthetics is the study of the perception of one's own body motions. Interaction design is the study of how users and technology communicate with each other. Combine these two fields and you get something with a satisfying and wholesome flavor. I, and many others, know it as <b>juicy design</b>, but I like to think of it as <b>UI/UX with UMAMI</b>. So how exactly do I explore savory flavors in software? Take a look at my exploratory projects below!

      A little bit about me first! I'm Kartik and I'm a generalist, which means I do a lot of things - a mile wide and an inch deep, if you will. My design philosphy is about using real world animation principles to help drive the flow of information between a human and a computer. It's about bringing principles of real-life charm into our digital world to provide fleeting moments of stimulus. The animation above is simply meant to showcase my animation timing skills. I paid special attention to offset the timing of every animated element.

      Above: My experimental basketball game! This game is an exploration of how to program charming reactionary elements with primitive animation. For example: the bendy goalpost rope seen above is a simply a bezier curve with <b>f=-kx</b> applied to the midpoint.

      Above is Zen Painter, a project I did to learn how surfaces work in Gamemaker Studio. Painting is generative, meaning brushes will take into account mouse speed and angle of the stroke. Sit back and let go, be creative with how you can control the stroke. <a href="https://kartik2d.itch.io/zen-painter">You can play it online here!</a>

      <b>Hot Take:</b> Gameplay design is just super experimental UI/UX design. The space shooter project above is an exageration of kinaesthetics and game juice principles. How do I design incredibly fun movement? What graphical elements should I exaggerate? I specifically went overboard on the screenshake and chromatic abberation for the chaotic feeling.

      The Mario model above was <b>sculpted entirely in VR!</b> This is a new field to me, but I'm incredibly excited about the usage of VR as a creative tool. Navigating a 3D space with a mouse and keyboard sucks, but in VR it's immediately intitiutive and natural! More sculptures to come!
